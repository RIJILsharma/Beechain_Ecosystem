# 🐝 BeeChain — Smart Beekeeping & Blockchain Traceability Platform

> An end-to-end IoT, AI, and Blockchain ecosystem for real-time apiary monitoring, predictive yield forecasting, and transparent honey provenance for consumers.

---

## 📌 Overview

**BeeChain** bridges advanced precision agriculture with consumer trust. By integrating IoT sensor networks, machine learning algorithms, and cryptographic ledger technology, BeeChain enables beekeepers to remotely track hive health and optimize honey harvests while providing end consumers with verifiable proof of origin, lab quality reports, and direct farm engagement.

## ✨ Key Features

### 👨‍🌾 Beekeeper Dashboard
* **Real-time IoT Telemetry:** Live tracking of internal brood temperature, humidity, scale weight, and ambient acoustic frequencies.
* **AI Swarm & Disease Detection:** Continuous acoustic frequency analysis to flag early queenlessness, swarming behavior, or hive distress.
* **Predictive Yield Modeling:** Random Forest ML model forecasting harvest yield based on current weight trends, floral bloom indexes, and local weather patterns.
* **Cryptographic Batch Minting:** On-chain block generation (SHA-256) for every harvested batch to secure moisture levels, pollen composition, and harvest location.

### 🔬 Customer & Traceability Portal
* **QR Code Provenance Verification:** Instant batch lookup providing full harvest lifecycle history from hive to bottle.
* **Lab Quality Reports:** Verifiable transparency on moisture content, sugar ratios, and pollen spectrums.
* **Interactive Farm Map & Eco-Tours:** Apiary locator and integrated visit planning tool for booking educational farm tours.
* **Complete Theme Customization:** Native support for high-contrast Light and Dark modes.
